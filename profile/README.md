# exVision: Computer Vision Concepts from Scratch

Welcome to exVision (short for "ex-Vision"), a GitHub organization dedicated to building classic computer vision concepts from scratch using Python and PyQt. Our name reflects the idea that while these algorithms were once ("ex") the primary tools in computer vision, they have largely been superseded by deep learning approaches in many applications. However, understanding these foundational concepts remains crucial for any aspiring computer vision engineer or researcher.

## About exVision

exVision is an educational initiative supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=r9pLu6EAAAAJ">Dr. Ahmed Badawy</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laila-abbas/">Eng. Laila Abbas</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-dawah-0aab5b314/">Eng. Omar Dawah</a> as part of the Classic Computer Vision class at the Systems and Biomedical Engineering Department, Cairo University, for the year 2024. Our goal is to provide hands-on experience in developing computer vision algorithms and embedding them in desktop applications using PyQt.
