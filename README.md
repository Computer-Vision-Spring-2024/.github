# exVision: Computer Vision Concepts from Scratch

Welcome to exVision, a GitHub organization dedicated to building computer vision concepts from scratch using Python and PyQt. Our projects focus on implementing classic computer vision algorithms without relying on pre-built libraries like OpenCV, providing a deep understanding of the underlying principles.

## About exVision

exVision is an educational initiative supervised by Dr. Ahmed Badawy, Eng. Laila, and Eng. Omar as part of the Classic Computer Vision class at the Systems and Biomedical Engineering Department, Cairo University, for the year 2024. Our goal is to provide hands-on experience in developing computer vision algorithms and embedding them in desktop applications using PyQt.

## Our Repositories

exVision consists of five main repositories, each focusing on different aspects of computer vision:

1. **BasicOperations**: Implements fundamental image processing techniques, including:
   - Edge detection
   - Thresholding
   - Hybrid images
   - Low-pass and high-pass filters
   - Noise addition
   - Histogram equalization
   - Image normalization

2. **HoughAndSnakes**: Focuses on advanced shape detection and object boundary tracking:
   - Hough Transform for line and circle detection
   - Active Contours (Snakes) for object boundary tracking

3. **SIFT**: Implements the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform algorithm for robust feature detection and description.

4. **SegmentationAndThresholding**: Explores advanced image segmentation techniques and thresholding methods.

5. **FaceDetectionAndRecognition**: Develops algorithms for detecting and recognizing faces in images.

Each repository contains Python implementations of the algorithms along with PyQt-based graphical user interfaces for easy interaction and visualization.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the exVision projects:

1. Clone the desired repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies (mainly PyQt and NumPy).
4. Run the main application file to launch the GUI.

Detailed instructions for setup and usage can be found in each repository's individual README file.

## Seeking Help

If you need assistance or have questions about any of the projects:

1. Check the repository's README and documentation first.
2. Look through existing issues in the repository to see if your question has already been addressed.
3. If you can't find an answer, feel free to open a new issue in the appropriate repository, providing as much detail as possible about your question or problem.
4. For general inquiries about the organization, you can reach out to the project supervisors or create an issue in our main organization repository.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from students and enthusiasts interested in computer vision! If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository you're interested in.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and ensure all tests pass.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

Please read the CONTRIBUTING.md file in each repository for specific guidelines.
